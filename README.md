# giphy-api

The idea behind this app is so you can search for all your favorite superhero gifs in one location! When you first go into the app, there are a few superhero buttons already created. If you do not see the superhero button you would like, just type it into the search bar and add a new button to the list!

Giphy-api uses an API call and jquery primarily with HTML and CSS for styling. As always if you need help with the app or would like to get in touch with me, I will link my portfolio below!
